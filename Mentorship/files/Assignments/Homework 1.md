Hello Team!

As we get started in this wonderful internship experience let's prepare ourselves with some basics and setups we'll need for the experience.

# Homework for week 1: Learn and research basics 101
+ What is weather, climate, animal behavior
+ What is meant by ecology and ecosystems
+ What role does weather and climate play in ecosystems

# Recommended setup/installations to be complete and be familiar with:
+ python
+ Jupyter notebook
+ Google colab
+ github

We will have a short download and discussion of what was learned in your search followed by a quiz for you to complete at the next session.  If you have any questions or want to chat, feel free to drop a line when needed.  Have a great first week and we'll see you on Thursday!

*Prepare a short summary or powerpoint slide deck addressing the topics

Best,
